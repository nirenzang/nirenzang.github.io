This page features my public talks and other outputs that aren't tied to a specific research paper.

* **My Biases against Every Consensus Protocol that is not Nakamoto Consensus** [[slides]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/20240409.MyBiases.pdf)], at [Web3 Scholars Conference](https://www.web3scholar.org/), 2024 Hong Kong Web3 Festival, April 9th, 2024 [[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIz8cB_YFWA)]; [Bitcoin Singapore](https://lu.ma/vobk70pd), March 8th, 2024.  

Critiques non-NC protocols (Bitcoin Unlimited, PoW alternatives, sharding, DAG, PoS). Arguments are drawn from academic publications, including both my own work and the work of others.

* **2020 to 2022 Blockchain Research Panorama** (秘猿区块链研究全景, in Chinese) [[bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/1887870712/channel/seriesdetail?sid=3197977)] with Yuncong Zhang, Yunwen Liu, Xiao Sui, Hongyin Chen, Wenxuan Zhao, and Zhichun Lu.

This series of lectures systematically introduces 500+ blockchain research papers published in top CS conferences from 2020 to 2022.

* **Testing PoW Consensus Algorithm Security** [[audio](https://zeroknowledge.fm/155-2/)] at Zero Knowledge Podcast Episode 155, Nov 11th, 2020.

"We chat about an earlier work he did on evaluating PoW consensus protocols security and explore his more recent work on NC-Max – a consensus protocol that breaks the throughput limit and enables the full utilization of the nodes’ bandwidth in confirming transactions."

* **How to Present** [[handout]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/20200716.HowToPresent.pdf)] on July 16th, 2020.

A talk on how to give a presentation.

* **Analyzing and Improving Proof-of-Work Consensus Protocols** [[slides]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/20191130.PublicDefense.pdf)] [[thesis](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/publications/thesis-331.pdf)] on Dec 2nd, 2019.

My PhD public defense.

* **What PoS Cannot Achieve (But PoW Can) and What PoW Cannot Achieve, Either** [[slides]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/20190703.WhatPoSCannotAchieve.pdf)] at Blockchain Center SF, May 21st, 2019 [[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxFm1QieUdE)]; Bitcoin Wednesday Amsterdam, July 3rd, 2019.

This lecture systematically explores the contributions of Nakamoto consensus (NC) and proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols. I began by outlining a framework for evaluating protocol security, then delved into NC's achievements and shortcomings. Subsequently, I assessed PoS protocols within the same context, highlighting their inherent, insurmountable limitations. Notably, these limitations have been independently identified and analyzed by other researchers in subsequent years.
