# Ren Zhang, 张韧
Director of Research @ Cryptape  
Researcher @ Nervos

I am a researcher working at [Cryptape](https://cryptape.com/#/home) and [Nervos](https://nervos.org/), exploring the frontiers of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. I earned my Ph.D. in 2019 from the [COSIC research group](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/) at KU Leuven, Belgium, supervised by [Professor Bart Preneel](http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~preneel/). During my doctoral studies, I gained practical experience through an internship at [Blockstream](https://blockstream.com/), where I collaborated with Bitcoin core developers [Pieter Wuille](https://x.com/pwuille) and Gregory Maxwell. Prior to my doctoral work, I completed both a Bachelor's degree in mathematics and a Master's degree in computer science from Peking University, China.
